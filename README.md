## ðŸ“‘ Project Description
This work proposes a **self-decoupling tri-port antenna** that utilizes **mode cancellation** and **active reflection coefficient theory** to achieve high isolation between ports without additional decoupling structures. The antenna operates in the 3.4â€“3.6 GHz band, targeting 5G smartphone applications. Key achievements include:
- **High isolation (>11 dB)** between ports.
- **Low envelope correlation coefficient (ECC < 0.14)**.
- **Total efficiency** ranging from **59.6% to 88.6%**.
- Compact 12Ã—12 MIMO system integration.

The design is validated through CST Microwave Studio simulations and experimental measurements.
